                  I designed this application with four fellow students as a project for the Media Technology 
                  and Interaction Design course, part of my Master's program at KTH.
                  <br><br>  
                  The course focused on both the theory and practice of the Double Diamond design method. Over two months, 
                  under the guidance of an experienced mentor, we completed the design process and delivered the high-fidelity 
                  prototype showcased below. <br>

<h4>The design brief 📌</h4>
<p>
  Our course design brief challenged us to create a technological solution that fosters interdependence in
   our increasingly individualistic world. We aimed to highlight the often-overlooked "ecology of care"—the essential, 
   interconnected support systems that sustain our daily lives.
      
<div >
  From the design approaches outlined by our professors, we chose to explore and reinterpret a daily activity through the lens of interdependence.
</div>
<br><br>

<h4>Process 🔄</h4>
<br>

  The workbook below provides a detailed overview of our design process:

<h5><b>A few key elements of the design process: </b></h5>

<br>

<h5>Discover phase</h5><br>
<h6>Interviews</h6>
<p>
  Semi-structured interviews were the first method that we used, because we wanted to get 
  insight into plant owners' thoughts and opinions. When conducting the interview questions, 
  we focused on having open ended questions in order to prevent steering the interviewees in a specific direction. <br>
  We conducted 9 interviews with participants of different ages and experience levels, with all 5 of us having 1-to-1 sessions 
  with the interviewees.<br>

  <h6>Diary studies</h6>
  <p>Along with the interviews, we conducted diary studies to explore the daily plant care routines of two individuals 
    over the course of a week. The diary studies captured their thoughts during plant care, along with photos and other reflections. 
    This was really helpful for understanding the personal experiences and challenges plant owners face in their daily routines.</p>
</p>

<h6>Product reviews</h6>
  <p>We aimed to explore the current market for products targeting our user group, focusing on understanding users' 
    reactions to these solutions. This helped us identify potential areas for improvement and opportunities to better meet their needs.
  </p>
<br>

<h5>Define phase</h5>
<p>We started the analysis of our data with color-coding the responses of the interviewees in an Excel 
  file according to the main themes or ideas they conveyed. 

<br>
Then we moved on by creating an affinity diagram and ranking the main themes occurring in the interviews, product reviews and diaries.<br>
   Our goal was to identify a problem that affects the majority of plant owners and ultimately develop a 
  problem statement based on these insights. 

</p>
<div class="work__image-box">

  </div>
<br>
  
<h6>Personas, POVs and "How might we" statements</h6>
 <p>
    After analyzing the data, we developed two distinct personas representing the extremes of our user group. 
    We then crafted scenarios and POVs for each persona to guide our design process.<br>
    We also experimented with formulating "How might we" statements to clarify our design goals and foster innovative thinking.<br>
    This allowed us to identify our problem statement: a lack of knowledge about plant care often leads to failure, 
    causing frustration among plant owners.
  </p>
  <br><br>

<h5>Develop phase</h5>
<p>
  We used various ideation methods, including brainwriting, "worst possible idea" brainstorming, 
  and moodboards. These techniques helped us outline the basic concept and core features of our application, 
  building directly on the problem statement from the previous phase.
<h6>Sketching and prototyping</h6><br>
Once we defined the core features, we used parallel design to create initial versions of our key screens. <br>
 We decided to design the app around the concept of plants as virtual pets, believing this approach would foster a
  stronger emotional connection between the plants and their owners.<br>
  <div class="work__image-box">
    <img src="./images/plant_sketch.png" class="work__image" alt="Sketches" />
    </div>
<br><br>
<h5>Deliver phase</h5>
<p>Following multiple rounds of sketching and refining ideas, we created a low-fidelity paper prototype. 
  We tested it using a combination of Wizard of Oz and Think Aloud methods. <br>
  The key insight from this initial testing was the need to make the watering function more intuitive for users.</p>
<p>
  We then transitioned our low-fidelity prototype to a digital format using Figma,
   refining it based on insights from the initial testing. Collaborating closely, 
   we applied a pre-established design kit and color palette to maintain consistency across all screens.
</p>
<h6>User testing</h6>
<p>We had the opportunity to test our high-fidelity prototype in two rounds: first with our classmates and supervisor, and then with users from our target group. <br>
  In both rounds, we used the same script and set of tasks, following the think-aloud method and concluding each session with a brief interview. <br>
  Following the second round of testing, we enhanced the clarity of certain UI elements based on feedback where testers encountered confusion. Additionally, 
  we refined the user flow by making the <i>details view</i> of a plant accessible directly from the <i>room view</i>.</p>
  <p>The feedback from the third round of testing was very positive, with users showing little to no confusion when interacting with the prototype. 
    They particularly appreciated features like the ability to drag the plant in the <i>room view</i>, noting that it made the interaction more enjoyable.</p>
    
  </p>
  



<h4>Solution 💡</h4>
</p>
In response to the design brief and our problem statement, we aimed to create a digital solution that enables users to better 
care for their plants. Our goal was to make plant care a more fulfilling and relaxing activity, fostering a deeper connection 
between the user and their plants.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that, due to time constraints, many ideas that could potentially enhance the application and better address 
  both the problem statement and design brief could not be fully explored or implemented.
</p>
<h6>Some of those ideas were:</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Enhancing the app's focus on interdependence by allowing users to connect and support each other </li>
  <li>Creating a community feature for users to exchange plant cuttings and share plant care tips </li>
  <li>Adding sound and music to improve accessibility and create a more immersive, relaxing experience</li>
</ul>
