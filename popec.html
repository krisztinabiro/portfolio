                <h2>How we started</h2>
                <p>I grew up in our family-run restaurant, Andreas Bistro, 
                    in the heart of Budapest. But like many others, we had to close down 
                    due to COVID. <br>In the summer of 2024, my partner and I decided to bring that 
                    energy back. With love and hard work, and a lot of help from our friends and family
                     we created PÃ¶pec â€” a cozy bar for locals
                     to feel at home, tucked among the tourist spots in the city center. ðŸ‘Œ</p>

                <h2>What I am doing in it</h2>
                <p>It was a passion project, so there were no limits on working hours throughout the 
                    summer! In addition to participating in the renovation (building benches, painting, 
                    cleaningâ€”everything that comes with it), we had to establish a company, which brought its 
                    fair share of paperwork and taught me a lot about patience and resilience.<br>

                    After we finally opened our doors on June 28th, 2024, I spent a lot of time behind the bar, 
                    while also being deeply involved in hiring and managing the team, keeping spirits high during 
                    those chaotic and challenging early days.

                <h2>How we grow</h2>
                    <p>At the moment, we really can't complain! For a business thatâ€™s just starting, we're 
                    doing pretty well, turning a profit from day one after opening. ðŸ˜‡ But what matters even 
                    more is that people seem to love the place â€” we get kind words and great reviews daily, 
                    and our regulars are steadily growing. ðŸ’›<br>

                    Now that Iâ€™m studying abroad, my partner continues to run things on the ground, while I 
                    manage our social media presence, assist with accounting, and handle all the administrative 
                    tasks.
