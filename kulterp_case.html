                    I designed this application during my internship at SmartX Solutions, a Hungarian software company, 
                    where I took full responsibility for the entire UX and UI design. Throughout the project, I was supervised 
                    by a mentor who provided invaluable guidance and support as I navigated various design challenges.

                    While the design presented below highlights my individual contributions, it’s important to acknowledge that 
                    the overall development process was a collaborative effort involving a dedicated team of developers and analysts.
                  <br><br>  
                  This software was developed and designed in Hungarian, specifically tailored for a unique client, with the potential 
                  for customization 
                  to meet the needs of various institutions in the future.<br><br>

<h4>Problem 📌</h4>
<p>
  A new legislation has made it mandatory for cultural institutions, such as theaters, 
  to utilize complex document management systems. 
      
<div >
    The main challenge of this project was to create a user-friendly desktop application 
    for a target audience unfamiliar with complex digital solutions, all while adhering to strict legal 
    requirements. Users were primarily motivated to adopt the new system due to external pressures and were satisfied 
    with their previous methods. Thus, we aimed to develop a solution that not only met the new regulations but also showed 
    users that the digital transition could be seamless and beneficial.
  
</div>
<br><br>

<h4>Process 🔄</h4>
<br>
<h5>Studying the legislation</h5>
<p>
Initially, we outlined the basic functionality of the application. As it needed approval from the authorities, 
we had to adhere to the rules specified in recent legislation. This required us to carefully examine the relevant 
laws and prepare the app's specification accordingly.<br>

Throughout this phase, I worked closely with our business analyst and legal consultant to delineate the application's features.
Additionally, I played a significant role in preparing the requirements specification.
</p>
<br>
<h5>Understanding our users</h5>
<p>
Once we understood the legal requirements for the application, we focused on identifying the specific 
needs of our target users in their daily workflows. Since we collaborated with the Budapest Operetta Theater,
 we had a well-defined user group, including accountants, secretaries, and other administrative staff members. This 
 clarity allowed us to tailor our design to meet their unique requirements effectively.
</p>
We used the following methods as part of the discovery period of our process:<br><br>
<h6>Task analysis</h6>

We employed this method because the product targeted specific work-related tasks that were initially unfamiliar to us. 
It was crucial for us to understand the frequently performed tasks and their steps, as we needed to familiarize ourselves 
with the intricacies of the field to create an effective solution.

<br>
<br>
<h6>Contextual inquiry</h6>
We believed this method would yield deeper insights than traditional interviews. By observing three key users performing 
their most frequent tasks with their current methods, we identified which workarounds would be most beneficial. This approach 
was invaluable in pinpointing areas where we could offer a better digital solution compared to their existing semi-digital processes, 
which primarily involved Excel spreadsheets and physical document storage. For example, we found that users could greatly benefit from a
 more efficient document search system that would allow them to link existing documents to newly created ones.
 <br>
<br>
<br>

<h5>Preparing sketches</h5>
<p>
I have begun the ideation process by creating sketches. These sketches include low-fidelity versions of the screens, 
which enable me to explore various layouts and user flows.<br>
</p>
<div class="work__image-box">
<img src="./images/kulterp_sketches.jpeg" class="work__image" alt="Kulterp sketches" />
</div>
<br>

<h5>User testing</h5>
<p>
    We conducted four rounds of user testing with five key users to ensure the app meets 
    their needs and facilitates a seamless transition from their current system. <br>
    Fortunately, we had three key users from the target group working closely with us, allowing us 
    to discuss initial sketches and iterate towards higher-fidelity prototypes while testing with them along the way. <br>

    Most of the time, we employed a talk-aloud method for testing, but we also held a brainstorming session aimed at
     outlining additional functions to simplify the most frequent task of adding a new document to the repository.<br><br>
 The continuous user testing allowed me to reconsider my design choices several times, making the design process iterative, resulting in a 28% increase in task success rate.
</p>
<h6>A few key insights:</h6><br>

<ul>
<li class="testing">Initially, I employed a nearly white background for the screens. However, after receiving feedback from prospective users who found it too bright and obtrusive, 
I made the decision to switch to an ivory background.</li><br>
<li class="testing">
At first, I implemented multilevel dropdown menus. However, based on the feedback received during testing, it became apparent that they contributed to more complex and extended user journeys. 
Additionally, since a majority of our prospective users are administrators utilizing a limited number of functions, I made the decision to simplify the user journeys. 
This involved linking each menu item directly to a frequently used function.
</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h4>Solution 💡</h4>
</p>
Through close collaboration with our clients and a careful study of the legislation, we aimed to design a user-friendly interface 
featuring meaningful icons to facilitate easy navigation. We also sought to minimize the learning curve by incorporating elements 
from the existing document management methods used by the theater.
</p>


<br>
<h5>Here are a few main features:</h5>
<br>



<div class="work__image-box">
<img src="./images/kulterp_2.svg" class="work__image" alt="Text from the image: Frequent feedback: Non-intrusive snackbars are provided as feedback, ensuring that users are aware of the progress of their current task. 
Feedback can also help users learn the application more quickly and increase their confidence." />
</div>


<div class="work__image-box">
<img src="./images/kulterp_temp.svg" class="work__image" alt="Text from the image: Document templates for efficiency:Pre-defined document formats or structures that can be customized and reused, ensuring consistency and standardization in document creation." />
</div>


<div class="work__image-box">
<img src="./images/kulterp_search.svg" class="work__image" alt="Text from the image: In-place search for easy document linking: Users can search for existing documents while registering a new one, making it easy to link the new document to an existing one. 
The search function allows users to search based on metadata or specific criteria, enabling them to quickly locate relevant and specific documents." />
</div>

<br><br>

<h4>UI decisions</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<br>
<li> 
Skeuomorphic buttons
</li>
<p>I chose to use skeuomorphic buttons paired with a paper-like background. <br>
    This approach aims to enhance the interface's intuitiveness, making the digital environment 
    feel more familiar for users who have primarily worked with physical documents in the past.
</p>
<br>
<li> 
Accordion
</li>
<p>
    User testing revealed that users complete forms more efficiently when all fields are visible at once without the need to scroll. This insight led to prioritizing the reduction of scrolling as a key design goal.  

To achieve this, I implemented accordion components on pages with extensive forms, particularly for sections that were auto-filled or optional. This approach helped streamline lengthy content, resulting in a cleaner and more user-friendly interface.
</p>
<br>
<li> 
Clarifying icons
</li>
<p>
To enhance the recognizability of call-to-action and navigation elements, I've incorporated a variety of clarifying icons 
into my design. <br>
Given the software's intended purpose for everyday work use, I believe that embedding glyph icons within the 
input fields and accentuating icons in the menubar significantly eases perception, 
thereby enhancing the overall efficacy of the software.
