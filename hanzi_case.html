                <h3>Chinese character learning through association</h3>
             
                    <p>
                        Research, as well as my own experience, highlights that learning Chinese 
                        characters is one of the most challenging aspects of studying the language for non-native speakers.<br>

In my Bachelor's thesis, I explored this issue by focusing on associative learning techniques for students from alphabet-based 
language backgrounds. I proposed a new learning technique—combining several established methods—designed specifically for digital environments. Then conducted an experiment to evaluate its effectiveness in comparison to traditional approaches.
                    </p><br>
                  <h6>Purpose of the prototype:</h6>
                  
                   
                  I conducted an experiment using the interactive high-fidelity prototype of the 
                  application, involving three groups of ten participants each, all with no prior experience in l
                  earning Chinese characters. The experiment compared three different learning techniques: the traditional 
                  method of repetitive copying, learning characters by their components, and an associative learning method. 
                  The associative method, deomstrated via a version of this prtotype, was significantly more effective than the other techniques,
                particularly in terms of long-term retention, resulting in an 84% increase in results among participants.

  <h4>Problem 📌</h4>
  <p>
    Learning to read, and especially to write, Chinese characters is widely 
    recognized as one of the most challenging parts of studying the language for foreigners. 
    Yet, the traditional method of repetitive writing is still commonly used in universities and 
    language courses, despite its limited effectiveness among non-native learners, particularly adults.<br>

    Chinese characters, though complex, are not without structure and logic. I believe that, with the right 
    techniques, learners can tap into their imagination and identify meaningful patterns within characters. This 
    approach can transform the perceived complexity of Chinese characters from a burden into a source of beauty, making 
    character study a more engaging and inspiring process.
</p>  
  <br><br>

<h4>Process 🔄</h4>
<br>
<h5>Testing learning apps and studying academic literature</h5>
<p>
    During the discover phase, I explored various learning apps such as Chineasy, 
    Anki, and Quizlet to gather useful design insights and identify areas for improvement. 
    I also reviewed academic literature on character teaching, learning techniques, associative learning, 
    and technology-enhanced learning methods, which helped inform the core methodology of my app.
</p>
<br>

<h5>Preparing sketches</h5>
<p>
Having solidified the core idea for the learning method, I proceeded to sketch out the essential features and user flows of the app. <br>
The specific sketch presented here is the culmination of multiple rounds of tweaking and refining.
</p>

</div>
<br>

<h5>Collaborating with Experts</h5>
<p>
    After finalizing my initial sketches, I collaborated with Chinese teachers and a university professor specializing in 
    learning methodology to discuss my proposed learning method and the low-fidelity prototype of the app. Their professional 
    insights were invaluable and led to several adjustments in my design.
</p>
<h6>One of the main features I added based on the opinion of experts:</h6><br>
<img src="./images/hanzi_1_1.svg" class="work__image" alt="Text from the image: Introducing the Favourites Feature: Recognizing that each learner has unique challenges, some may struggle with specific characters rather than entire lessons. The Favourites feature allows users to create personalized lists of characters for future review or separate storage. 
This feature not only facilitates character-specific review but also enables users to add new characters, providing flexibility for various study materials while maintaining the app's original lesson structure." />
<br><br>

<h5>User testing</h5>
<p>
I conducted three rounds of user testing, both on the low-fidelity and the high-fidelity prototype. 
Both my fellow students in the Chinese department and 
beginner language learners were involved. I employed the think aloud method as I believed it allowed me to understand the
user behaviour more effectively. I have also asked follow-up questions after each session, which helped me to identify further areas of
improvement. The user testing yielded invaluable insights and identified pain points. This iterative 
process enabled me to revisit and enhance the prototype based on the valuable feedback received from users.

</p>
<h6>Improving flashcard interaction</h6><br>
<img src="./images/hanzi_bef_af.svg" class="work__image" alt="Simple Hanzi before and after design - Text from the image:Originally, users could mark cards as 'Know' or 'Still learning' by dragging them to the side, but this interaction proved less intuitive for many. In the updated design, I incorporated clearer hints and removed the drag feature for a more user-friendly experience. " />

<h4>Solution 💡</h4>
  </p>
  After examining other character learning apps and techniques, I worked 
  closely with teachers and learning experts to design an interface that facilitates the learning progress of characters.
</p>


<br>
<h5>Here are a few main features:</h5>
<br>

 

<div class="work__image-box">
  <img src="./images/hanzi_rounds.svg" class="work__image" alt="Text from the image: Multiple and various study rounds for effective learning: Employing proven study techniques, the three learning rounds per lesson are crafted in collaboration with educators and experts to enhance effectiveness. This approach ensures users experience a sense of accomplishment after each session. 
The flexibility to skip rounds allows for tailored learning experiences and convenient reviews after the initial learning phase." />
</div>


<div class="work__image-box">
  <img src="./images/hanzi_2.svg" class="work__image" alt="Text from the image: Playful interface and frequent reinforcement for gamification: Gamification can be an effective way to make repetitive learning less exhausting. The colourful and slightly childish design aims to make the app feel more like a game than a serious learning tool. This approach helps alleviate the stress and anxiety often associated with challenging tasks, making the learning journey more enjoyable and engaging for users." />
</div>


<div class="work__image-box">
  <img src="./images/hanzi_3.svg" class="work__image" alt="Text from the image: Streak tracking for maintaining motivation: It can be quite challenging to consistently maintain learning over the long run. I wanted to create a motivation system that is unobtrusive and doesn't take away from the focus on learning, while still providing enough positive feedback. 
Tracking streaks is an undeniably effective method to boost user engagement. It is extensively utilized by numerous social media and learning applications." />
</div>

<br><br>

<h4>UI decisions</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<br>
<li> 
Glassmorphic design
</li>
<p>The glass morph effect is currently popular, and I believe it could be seamlessly 
incorporated into the design of this app. This effect allows for the implementation of colorful backgrounds 
while ensuring legibility, creating a modern yet playful user interface. <br>

</p>
<br>
<li> 
Hand-drawn menu page
</li>
<p>
The menu page, with its almost childish appearance, not only establishes a playful and creative tone for 
the application but also incorporates Chinese characters into objects associated with their meanings. <br>
I believe that this distinctive interface plays a pivotal role in fostering a relaxed and open mindset for users, 
setting the stage for a positive learning experience as they begin their session.
